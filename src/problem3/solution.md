## Computational Inefficiencies and anti-Patterns in the Code
### 1. Unnecessary *useMemo* dependency on *prices*:

The **sortedBalances** computation is dependent on **balances** and **prices**. However, **prices** are not used within the **useMemo** function itself.

Refactor: Remove prices from the dependency array.

### 2. Incorrect variable reference (lhsPriority):

The variable **lhsPriority** is used in the filter logic, but it is not defined within the function scope. This results in a reference error.

Refactor: Correct the variable reference by using the appropriate variable **balancePriority**.

### 3. Filter logic inefficiency:

The filter logic checks for balances with a priority greater than -99 and amounts less than or equal to zero. This logic is ambiguous and potentially incorrect for the given purpose.

Refactor: Clarify and correct the filter condition to reflect the intended logic.

### 4. Double mapping over *sortedBalances*:

The code maps over **sortedBalances** twice: once to format the balances and once to create the **rows**. This can be optimized by combining these operations into a single map.

Refactor: Combine formatting and row creation in a single map function to avoid iterating over the array twice.

### 5. Type inconsistency:

The **balance** object in **rows** mapping is typed as **FormattedWalletBalance**, but **sortedBalances** contains **WalletBalance**. This inconsistency can cause type errors.

Refactor: Ensure consistent types between **sortedBalances** and the **balance** object used in **rows**.

### 6. Implicit any type:
The **blockchain** parameter in **getPriority** has an implicit **any** type, which can lead to type safety issues.

Refactor: Ensure **blockchain** parameter in **getPriority** is typed as **string**.

### 7. Redefinition of **getPriority**:
The **getPriority** function is defined inside the component, causing it to be redefined on every render. This is unnecessary since the function does not depend on any props or state.

Refactor: Move the **getPriority** function outside of the component.

### 8. Incorrect filter condition
The original filter condition checked if **balance.amount <= 0**, which is likely a mistake if the intention is to display balances with a positive amount.

Refactor: Update the filter condition to **balance.amount > 0** to ensure only balances with a positive amount are considered.

## Refactored Code
```
interface WalletBalance {
  currency: string;
  amount: number;
  blockchain: string;
}

interface FormattedWalletBalance extends WalletBalance {
  formatted: string;
}

interface Props extends BoxProps {}

const getPriority = (blockchain: string): number => {
  switch (blockchain) {
    case 'Osmosis':
      return 100;
    case 'Ethereum':
      return 50;
    case 'Arbitrum':
      return 30;
    case 'Zilliqa':
    case 'Neo':
      return 20;
    default:
      return -99;
  }
};

const WalletPage: React.FC<Props> = (props: Props) => {
  const { children, ...rest } = props;
  const balances = useWalletBalances();
  const prices = usePrices();

  const sortedBalances = useMemo(() => {
    return balances
      .filter((balance: WalletBalance) => {
        const balancePriority = getPriority(balance.blockchain);
        return balancePriority > -99 && balance.amount > 0;
      })
      .sort((lhs: WalletBalance, rhs: WalletBalance) => {
        const leftPriority = getPriority(lhs.blockchain);
        const rightPriority = getPriority(rhs.blockchain);
        return leftPriority > rightPriority ? -1 : 1;
      });
  }, [balances]);

  const rows = sortedBalances.map((balance: WalletBalance, index: number) => {
    const usdValue = prices[balance.currency] * balance.amount;
    const formattedBalance: FormattedWalletBalance = {
      ...balance,
      formatted: balance.amount.toFixed(2),
    };
    return (
      <WalletRow
        className={classes.row}
        key={index}
        amount={balance.amount}
        usdValue={usdValue}
        formattedAmount={formattedBalance.formatted}
      />
    );
  });

  return (
    <div {...rest}>
      {rows}
    </div>
  );
};
```
## Explanation of Improvements

1. The *prices* dependency was removed from the *useMemo* array since it's not used inside the *useMemo* function.

2. The reference to the undefined variable *lhsPriority* was corrected to *balancePriority*.

3. The filter condition was clarified to reflect the intended logic by ensuring it checks for balances with a priority greater than -99 and an amount less than or equal to zero.

4. The formatting of *balances* and creation of *rows* were combined into a single map function, reducing the need to iterate over *sortedBalances* twice.

5. Ensured consistent typing by using *WalletBalance* throughout and correctly extending it to *FormattedWalletBalance* where necessary.

6. Ensured **blockchain** parameter in **getPriority** is typed as **string**.

7. Moved the **getPriority** function outside of the component.

8. Updated the filter condition to check for **balance.amount > 0** to make the logic clear and correct based on the likely intention, ensuring only balances with a positive amount are considered.
